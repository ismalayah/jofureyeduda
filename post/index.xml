Ludwig’s sex life in this film consists of a few enigmatic conversations with Elizabeth of Austria (Romy Schneider), a homosexual orgy which begins low-key and ends with everyone asleep, and lots and lots of penetrating stares.

As the needy Sean takes his new companion&amp;nbsp;Ernesto through recognizable landmarks like&amp;nbsp;Echo Park, Sean talks at Ernesto about his problems, treating him like the therapist he should have seen long ago. Ernesto can share how many children he has, because Sean knows some numbers in Spanish, but that’s pretty much it.</description></item><item><title>Beneil Dariush Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</title><link>/beneil-dariush.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/beneil-dariush.html</guid><description>Explore Beneil Dariush net worth, age, height, bio, birthday, wiki, and salary!

Ruminate on that a bit. A franchise born of a genre Hollywood never properly took seriously has somehow grown into a cash cow the box office can hardly live without. 32 films across 14 years, generating over $28 billion collectively. That’s more than the Star Wars, Harry Potter, and James Bond franchises combined.&amp;nbsp;

It’s both existential and enjoyable, which is a challenge to achieve in any genre.
