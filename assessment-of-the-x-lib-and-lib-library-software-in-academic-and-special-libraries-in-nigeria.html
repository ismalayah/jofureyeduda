Six research questions and one hypothesis guided the study. A total of nine academic libraries and eleven special libraries in Nigeria were selected for the study. The selection was based on the libraries that make use of the two software under study. Data relevant to the study was collected using the questionnaire method. A total of 73 copies out of 73 of the questionnaire returned were found usable, signifying 100% response. One hypothesis was tested. Data were analyzed using percentage and mean scores. The hypothesis was tested with T-test of Independent Means. The findings reveal that the method used for library software application in academic and special libraries is mainly by recommendation; most academic and special libraries select their software based on its compatibility with existing hardware, failure of the previous software to support library operations, user-friendliness of the software, persuasions from the company that designed the software and the fact that most libraries are using the software; all the academic and special libraries that use LIB+ assessed it as higher than X-LIB in that it has more features than X-LIB, it is more user-friendly, it has more networking environment support, it is more compatible with the existing library hardware, it has more modules, it supports library operations more than X-LIB; the major problems encountered in the usage of library software in academic and special libraries are hanging of systems, abnormal termination, corruption of data, back-up errors, and errors in import and export; strategies for enhancing library software utilization in academic and special libraries include proper training of staff, provision of software manuals, good working environment, adequate software design, release of funds, sorting of network problems, and purchase of adequate software. Test of hypothesis showed there is no statistically significant [p&lt;0.05] difference between the assessment of X-LIB and LIB+ as software in academic libraries; there is no statistically significant [p&lt;0.05] difference between the assessment of X-LIB and LIB+ software application in special libraries. Appropriate recommendations were proffered which include academic and special libraries should select their software based on its compatibility with existing hardware, failure of the previous software to support library operations, user-friendliness of the software, persuasions from the company that designed the software and the fact that most libraries are using the software; Strategies to enhance effective utilization of software in academic and special libraries should be devised such as: proper training of staff, provision of software manuals, good working environment, adequate software design, release of funds, sorting of network problems, and purchase of adequate software.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>INTRODUCTION</p><p>Background of the Study In higher institutions, there exist libraries where academic resources are housed for the library clientele. Resources of this kind could come in form of physical materials such as theses, dissertations, books, inaugural lectures, institution newsletters, ephemeras, grey literature – which are materials that can hardly be found elsewhere, or electronic materials such as Compact Disk Read-Only-Memory (CD-ROM), Internet resources – which are located in databases, but could be thereafter be printed and bounded in hard covers for perusal. Such higher institution libraries that house the aforementioned kind of materials are called academic libraries. Edoka (2000) pointed out that academic libraries exist in higher institutions of higher education such as universities, colleges of education, colleges of technology polytechnics. Academic libraries are libraries in Universities (public and private), Colleges of Education, Polytechnics and Monotechnics. Their collection is tailored towards achievement of the institution goals of teaching, learning and research. They serve the students, lecturers, administrative members of the academic communities as well as others (Omekwu and Ugwuanyi, 2009).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3Cxw66amqyZpLtwvNGooZ6bpGLBsLzInKpomaOosrS%2FzJ6lrWWfm3q1tMRmr2akmZd6orrDZqOiml2htqO%2BwKuwZqufm8G4rdGeZKKmXZaworDEpqCcZZGjsW6%2Fz56aopmcYrmqrtGaqaKdo2K2r3nNop6eqpmWfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./femi-ogunrombi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Femi Ogunrombi- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity">&larr;
