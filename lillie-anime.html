However, Lillie never knew her father growing up as she was very young when he disappeared in an accident and was presumed dead.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM047>A Masked Warning!</a></i>, Gladion revealed that she developed a crippling fear of touching <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a> after an incident occurred during a visit to <a href=# title="Aether Paradise">Aether Paradise</a>, where she was attacked by an <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Ultra Beast</a> that was later identified in <i><a href=# title=SM055>The Professors' New Adventure!</a></i> as <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Nihilego</a>. According to Gladion, a <a href=# title="Type: Null (Pokémon)">Type: Null</a> rescued her from Nihilego. The trauma Lillie suffered caused her to suppress her memory of the event.</p><p>Lillie returned to her Hau'oli estate while her mother remained behind and her brother ran away, leaving her under the care of her family's servants, including Hobbes. Despite her fear, Lillie continued to enjoy studying Pokémon and subsequently enrolled at the <a href=# title="Pokémon School">Pokémon School</a> on <a href=# title="Melemele Island">Melemele Island</a>.

She quickly demonstrated her fear of Pokémon when she cowered behind Ash upon being approached by one of the Tauros, only to be startled by his <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>. Later, when Ash described an unfamiliar Pokémon that he but no one else had witnessed, Lillie deduced that he saw <a href=# title="Guardian deities (anime)">Tapu Koko</a>, the island's <a href=# title="Guardian deities">guardian deity</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM002>The Guardian's Challenge</a></i>, after Ash enrolled in the school and showed his new classmates the <a href=# title=Z-Ring>Z-Ring</a> he received from Tapu Koko, Lillie explained the guardian's fickle and mischievous nature to him. She and the other classmates saw Tapu Koko for themselves when it appeared to challenge Ash and Pikachu to a <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">Pokémon battle</a>, during which Lillie advised Ash about Tapu Koko's techniques.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM008>Lillie's Egg-xhilarating Challenge!</a></i>, Lillie agreed to watch over a newly discovered <a href=# title="Pokémon Egg">Pokémon Egg</a> from <a href=# title="Mount Lanakila">Mount Lanakila</a> for a class assignment, seeing it as an opportunity to finally overcome her fear of touching Pokémon. After several failed exercises at petting Ash's Pikachu, <a href=# title="Ash's Rowlet">Rowlet</a>, and <a href=# title="Rotom Pokédex (anime)">Rotom</a>, Lillie was able to touch the Egg when she instinctively shielded it from a <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild</a> <a href=# title="Salandit (Pokémon)">Salandit</a>.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/fe/Lillie_fear_of_Pok%C3%A9mon.png/330px-Lillie_fear_of_Pok%C3%A9mon.png decoding=async width=220 height=281 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie's fear of touching Pokémon<p>In <i><a href=# title=SM013>Racing to a Big Event!</a></i>, Lillie watched her friends participate in the <a href=# title="Pokémon Pancake Race">Pokémon Pancake Race</a>. At the end of the episode, her Egg hatched and was discovered to be an <a href=# title="Alolan form">Alolan</a> <a href=# title="Vulpix (Pokémon)">Vulpix</a>.</p><p>Lillie officially caught the Vulpix, which she <a href=# title=Nickname>nicknamed</a> <a href=# title=Snowy>Snowy</a>, in <i><a href=# title=SM014>Getting to Know You!</a></i>, making her a <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Pokémon Trainer</a> like the others. Though her fear of touching Pokémon initially persisted, she spent time bonding with Snowy. Eventually they were confronted by <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>, and Snowy used <a href=# title="Powder Snow (move)">Powder Snow</a> to protect Lillie from <a href=# title="James's Mareanie">Mareanie</a>. When Snowy was blasted off a rooftop by Mareanie's <a href=# title="Sludge Bomb (move)">Sludge Bomb</a>, Lillie leapt off after it and caught it in her arms. They were saved by Ash's Rowlet. After that, Team Rocket was frozen by Snowy's Powder Snow and taken away by <a href=# title="Bewear (anime)">Bewear</a>. From that point on, Lillie was okay with holding Snowy, though she still froze at contact with other Pokémon.</p><p>Lillie was reunited with her brother in <i><a href=# title=SM027>A Glaring Rivalry!</a></i>. Gladion was surprised by the fact that Lillie was able to touch Pokémon again and told her to treasure her Vulpix. Lillie was troubled by how much more cold and distant Gladion appeared to be from the last time Lillie saw him six months ago, but Ash reassured her that Gladion was still a good person, reminding her of her brother's words of encouragement. At the end of the episode, Lillie arrived at the beach, where Ash and Gladion had held a battle, and became annoyed by the fact that her brother took off so early without saying goodbye.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM030>The Ol' Raise and Switch!</a></i>, <a href=# title="Professor Kukui (anime)">Professor Kukui</a> tasked everyone with switching their partner Pokémon with somebody else. Pikachu was given to Lillie while Snowy went to Ash. At first, Lillie's fear gave her trouble getting closer to Pikachu. After a battle with Hobbes in which she managed to defeat his <a href=# title="Oricorio (Pokémon)">Oricorio</a>, she found herself able to touch Pikachu when she gave him a hug in celebration. After the weekend had passed by, she showed her surprised classmates that she was able to touch Pikachu at will. Lillie then promised herself to take it step by step until she was able to touch every kind of Pokémon.</p><p>Lillie once again combated her fear in <i><a href=# title=SM032>Treasure Hunt, Akala Style!</a></i>, where she decided to use a Ride Pokémon, <a href=# title="Stoutland (Pokémon)">Stoutland</a>, without any protection. She was initially overwhelmed and ran away, but after some encouraging words from Professor Kukui and <a href=# title=Olivia>Olivia</a>, and remembering what led to her recent experiences of touching Snowy and Pikachu, she was finally able to ride Stoutland by the end of the day. Although she couldn't join the treasure hunt with the others during the episode due to her fear, Professor Kukui stated that she found her own treasure, being one step closer to overcoming her fear for good.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM043>When Regions Collide!</a></i>, she and <a href=# title="Sophocles (anime)">Sophocles</a> had a <a href=# title="Multi Battle">Multi Battle</a> against <a href=# title="Brock (anime)">Brock</a>. Sophocles started attacking first, but he made the mistake of thinking that <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric</a>-type moves would work on <a href=# title="Brock's Geodude">Brock's Geodude</a>. Lillie then assured him that she got this and commanded Snowy to use Powder Snow. Much to her and Sophocles' surprise, Brock countered the attack by using a <a href=# title="Counter Shield">Counter Shield</a>. After the battle was over, she was fascinated by how amazing <a href=# title="Gym Leader">Gym Leaders</a> were.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/b/b4/Lillie_fear_overcome.png/375px-Lillie_fear_overcome.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie, no longer afraid of touching Pokémon<p>Lillie was present in <i><a href=# title=SM044>A Dream Encounter!</a></i> when Ash brought a <a href=# title="Cosmog (Pokémon)">Cosmog</a> he had discovered to class; because no one knew the Pokémon's name, Lillie decided to name it <a href=# title=Nebby>Nebby</a>. Later, Lillie reunited with Lusamine, demonstrating her annoyance with her mother for treating her like a young child. Lillie further explained how her mother never seemed to respect her wishes, revealing that Lusamine once <a href=# title=Evolution>evolved</a> a <a href=# title="Lusamine's Clefable">Clefairy</a> Lillie wanted to take care of, finding her daughter's reason for wanting to keep it unevolved to be illogical.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM048>Night of a Thousand Poses!</a></i>, Lillie argued with Lusamine for putting work before her family and demanded not to be bothered by her anymore. She later regretted their fight, wanting to meet Gladion again as well. This desire caused Nebby to teleport her to <a href=# title="Ten Carat Hill">Ten Carat Hill</a>, where Gladion was hiding with "Silvally", the same <a href=# title="Type: Null (Pokémon)">Type: Null</a> that rescued her as a child. The sight of Type: Null caused Lillie's repressed memory of it lunging at her to resurface, making her believe it had attacked her. This once again rendered her unable to touch any Pokémon, including Snowy.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM049>Mission: Total Recall!</a></i>, Lillie decided to travel to various locations related to her past in order to fully regain the memories of the incident that made her unable to touch Pokémon. With the assistance of Ash and Nebby, Lillie went to several different locations before ending up at the Secret Lab area of Aether Paradise. Immediately upon arrival, Lillie and Ash were attacked by <a href=# title="Faba (anime)">Faba</a>, who aimed to prevent Lillie from regaining her memories, as it would risk putting himself in trouble. Faba was defeated by the timely arrival of Gladion and Lusamine. In order to save Lillie, Type: Null evolved into <a href=# title="Silvally (Pokémon)">Silvally</a> and defeated Faba's Pokémon. Now remembering her full past and realizing Silvally never attacked her, Lillie apologized to Silvally for misjudging it and hugged it in gratitude for saving her life, which allowed her to get over her trauma completely and regain the ability to touch all types of Pokémon.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM050>Faba's Revenge!</a></i>, Lillie enjoyed her regained ability to touch Pokémon by playing with them at the Pokémon School. When Faba kidnapped Nebby and took it to Aether Paradise while everyone was distracted, Lillie and Ash immediately gave pursuit, joined by Gladion and Lusamine. They headed to Faba's location, only to find that he successfully forced Nebby to summon a Nihilego from an <a href=# title="Ultra Wormhole">Ultra Wormhole</a>. The group tried to fight off Nihilego, but it proved too powerful and easily defeated their Pokémon. When Gladion tried to protect his family from the Ultra Beast, Lusamine pushed him out of the way and was captured instead. Nihilego then proceeded to drag Lusamine into the Ultra Wormhole while Lillie watched in horror.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/ea/Lillie%27s_Second_Outfit.png/375px-Lillie%27s_Second_Outfit.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie's second, temporary outfit<p>In <i><a href=# title=SM051>Family Determination!</a></i>, Lillie decided to set off to rescue her mother, donning a new set of clothes to begin her journey. She was joined by Gladion, and the two snuck out at night to head towards the <a href=# title="Altar of the Sunne">Altar of the Sunne</a> on <a href=# title="Poni Island">Poni Island</a>. After making their way through the island, they found themselves in battle with a group of <a href=# title="Jangmo-o (Pokémon)">Jangmo-o</a> and <a href=# title="Hakamo-o (Pokémon)">Hakamo-o</a> led by a <a href=# title="Totem Pokémon">Totem</a> <a href=# title="Kommo-o (Pokémon)">Kommo-o</a>. With Lillie's knowledge of <a href=# title=Type>types</a>, Gladion gave Silvally a <a href=# title="Fairy Memory">Fairy Memory</a>, allowing it to easily defeat Totem Kommo-o. The two were quickly joined by Ash and the other classmates, who had decided to help them rescue Lusamine.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM053>Rescuing the Unwilling!</a></i>, Lillie and the others arrived at <a href=# title="Ultra Deep Sea">Ultra Deep Sea</a>, where they found that Lusamine had fused with Nihilego. Lusamine, reduced to a childlike state, claimed the Ultra Beasts as her own possessions and fled in order to prevent the group from taking them away from her. As the group chased Lusamine down, most of her classmates were forced to stay behind in order to fight off Lusamine's Pokémon, who had been powered up due to Nihilego's influence, until only Gladion, Ash, and Lillie herself were left. Lillie was forced to stay behind in order to battle Lusamine's <a href=# title="Clefable (Pokémon)">Clefable</a>, though she was assisted by Ash's <a href=# title="Ash's Lycanroc">Lycanroc</a>. Due to the bonds she had with Clefable, Lillie was able to free it from Nihilego's control.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM054>10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!</a></i>, Lillie and Gladion joined Ash in battling Lusamine herself. During the battle, Lillie vented to Lusamine about all of the things she hated about her and begged her mother to try and fight Nihilego's control. Lillie's speech managed to return Lusamine to her senses, but when she tried reaching out to Lillie, Nihilego took full control of their fused form and attacked. With the power of their newly gained <a href=# title="Pikashunium Z">Pikashunium Z</a>, Ash and Pikachu used a powerful <a href=# title="10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt (move)">10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt</a> that defeated Nihilego, freeing Lusamine from its control in the process. Afterward, Lillie finally reconciled with Lusamine and took her back to their world with the others.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM055>The Professors' New Adventure!</a></i>, Lillie returned to her usual attire. She attended the wedding of Professor Kukui and <a href=# title="Professor Burnet (anime)">Professor Burnet</a>. During the post-nuptials, Lillie and her classmates accepted Lusamine's invitation to join the <a href=# title="Ultra Guardians">Ultra Guardians</a>, a task force dedicated to catching stray Ultra Beasts and returning them to their natural habitats.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d3/Lillie_Ultra_Guardian_outfit.png/375px-Lillie_Ultra_Guardian_outfit.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie in her Ultra Guardians uniform<p>As a part of the Ultra Guardians, Lillie and her Pokémon have been critical to the success of the group's missions. In <i><a href=# title=SM061>A Mission of Ultra Urgency!</a></i>, Lillie and her classmates were given their first task, capturing a <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Buzzwole</a> that emerged from an Ultra Wormhole onto Melemele Island and began causing havoc. During the mission, Lillie helped heal a wild <a href=# title="Snorlax (Pokémon)">Snorlax</a> that was drained of its energy by the Ultra Beast.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM078>Twirling with a Bang!</a></i>, Lillie and her classmates watched a fireworks show. The show was interrupted by a strange creature that used its exploding head to create a fireworks show of its own. The next day, the Ultra Guardians were called down by Lusamine, who revealed the creature from before was the Ultra Beast <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Blacephalon</a>. The Ultra Guardians set off to find Blacephalon, but their efforts to track it down only led to a different Ultra Beast, later named <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Xurkitree</a> by Lusamine. Eventually, Lillie managed to catch Blacephalon with the assistance of <a href=# title="Mallow (anime)">Mallow</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Mallow's Steenee">Steenee</a> while <a href=# title="Lana (anime)">Lana</a> caught Xurkitree, allowing the two Ultra Beasts to be later released back to their homes.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/06/Lillie_Icium_Z.png/375px-Lillie_Icium_Z.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie after receiving an Icium Z<p>In <i><a href=# title=SM080>Not Caving Under Pressure!</a></i>, Lillie and her classmates traveled back to Melemele Island after <a href=# title=SM079>spending time</a> at <a href=# title="Hokulani Observatory">Hokulani Observatory</a>. After taking a shortcut to the ferry, the group got lost in an ice cave at <a href=# title="Mount Lanakila">Mount Lanakila</a> and were separated into multiple small groups. There, Lillie, Mallow, and Sophocles befriended a group of <a href=# title="Alolan form">Alolan</a> <a href=# title="Sandshrew (Pokémon)">Sandshrew</a>, who were training to battle a <a href=# title="Tyranitar (Pokémon)">Tyranitar</a> that had invaded their territory. Lillie used Snowy and the leader Sandshrew in a <a href=# title="Double Battle">Double Battle</a> against the Tyranitar and successfully drove it away. The leader Sandshrew used an <a href=# title="Ice Stone">Ice Stone</a> that Sophocles's <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Sophocles's Charjabug">Charjabug</a> had found to evolve into a <a href=# title="Sandslash (Pokémon)">Sandslash</a> and awarded Lillie an <a href=# title="Icium Z">Icium Z</a> as thanks. After Lillie's group reunited with the others, Sophocles gave Lillie another Ice Stone that Charjabug had found. She offered to let Snowy evolve with the stone, but it refused out of fear. As a result, Lillie decided to hold on to the stone in case Snowy ever changed her mind.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM087>Filling the Light with Darkness!</a></i>, mysterious dark clouds appeared over the Alola region, causing all of the adults in Alola to lose their energy and motivation. The next day, Lillie and her classmates embarked on their fifth mission, to investigate the situation at the <a href=# title="Altar of the Sunne">Altar of the Sunne</a>. Shortly after arriving, Lusamine revealed that Gladion would be joining them as a new member. In order to disperse the clouds, Lana, <a href=# title="Kiawe (anime)">Kiawe</a>, Ash, and Gladion combined their <a href=# title=Z-Power>Z-Power</a> to fuel a device that successfully made the clouds disappear, but they uncovered a hidden Ultra Wormhole in the process. Afterward, Lusamine took the Ultra Guardians into the ruins, where she showed them a mural depicting the "<a href=# title="Necrozma (Pokémon)">Blinding One</a>". Before they could translate the mural, the Ultra Guardians were forced to return outside, where they found the wormhole increasing in size. At that moment, a <a href=# title="Lunala (anime)">Lunala</a> emerged from the wormhole with a <a href=# title="Necrozma (anime)">Necrozma</a> chasing after it. The group was eventually able to solve the unfolding crisis in <i><a href=# title=SM090>Securing the Future!</a></i>, where they, their Pokémon, Lunala, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Poipole">Poipole</a>'s friends, and everyone else back in Alola shared their Z-Power with Necrozma, causing it to release <a href=# title=Nebby>Nebby</a>. After Ash and Gladion used Nebby and Lunala to replenish Necrozma's strength to revert it to its <a href=# title="List of Pokémon with form differences">true form</a>, it restored Poipole's homeworld back to its original state. Afterward, the Ultra Guardians, Nebby, and Lunala traveled back to Alola through the Ultra Wormhole.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM104>That's Some Spicy Island Research!</a></i>, Lillie and her classmates arrived on Poni Island to do individual research projects for school. Lillie's project was to study the numerous Pokémon living on the island. In <i><a href=# title=SM105>Showdown on Poni Island!</a></i>, Lillie encountered Gladion again and learned that he had come to Poni Island to participate in a grand trial, which involved a battle against <a href=# title="Guardian deities (anime)">Tapu Fini</a>. Gladion revealed that he wanted to see their father Mohn, and Tapu Fini was rumored to have the ability to allow anyone to meet with those that have died. Lillie offered to battle Gladion to summon Tapu Fini, but it was interrupted by Ash, who crash-landed in front of them after being sent flying by <a href=# title=Hapu>Hapu</a>'s <a href=# title="Mudsdale (Pokémon)">Mudsdale</a>. Believing that a battle between Ash and Gladion would be more exciting, Lillie suggested they battle each other instead. While watching the battle, Lillie explained to Hapu how much she learned from Ash and how an <a href=# title="Island kahuna">island kahuna</a> brings out the strength between a Trainer and their Pokémon. After Gladion won the battle, Lillie witnessed Tapu Fini flying above the quartet. In <i><a href=# title=SM108>Memories in the Mist!</a></i>, Lillie ended up being trapped in Tapu Fini's mist alongside Gladion. Despite wandering around and searching for their father, Mohn never appeared in front of them. After learning from Hapu that this could indicate he is still alive, they decided to tell Lusamine about it.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/0a/Lillie_and_Z-Ring.png/375px-Lillie_and_Z-Ring.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie and her Z-Ring<p>In <i><a href=# title=SM116>The Secret Princess!</a></i>, Lusamine took Lillie and Gladion to Mohn's old study, where they found Mohn's <a href=# title=Z-Ring>Z-Ring</a> and an inactive <a href=# title="Shiny Pokémon">Shiny</a> <a href=# title=Mohn>Magearna</a> that Mohn planned to repair and give to Lillie, but was unable to activate it before he disappeared. Wanting to become stronger, Lillie, along with her classmates and Professor Kukui, asked <a href=# title=Hala>Hala</a> if she could use the Z-Ring. Sensing Lillie's determination, Hala had Lillie and Snowy perform <a href=# title="Subzero Slammer (move)">Subzero Slammer</a> in front of him. Though their effort to use the <a href=# title=Z-Move>Z-Move</a> failed, Lillie was allowed to hold on to the Z-Ring until Mohn returned. Later, after consulting Gladion and Lusamine, Lillie decided to care for <a href=# title="Magearna (Pokémon)">Magearna</a> and activate it herself.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM127>Chasing Memories, Creating Dreams!</a></i>, Lillie invited her classmates to her house for some Z-Move training and subsequently introduced them to Magearna. Later, she and the others watched as Professor Kukui officially unveiled the <a href=# title="Manalo Stadium">Manalo Stadium</a> to the people of Alola. After seeing how the others were excited to compete in the <a href=# title="Pokémon League (Alola)">Alola League</a>, Lillie continued her training and successfully managed to execute Subzero Slammer with Snowy.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM129>Battle Royal 151!</a></i>, Lillie was among the 151 Trainers taking part in the <a href=# title="Battle Royal">Battle Royal</a> preliminary round of the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a>. Using Snowy, Lillie was among the 16 Trainers still standing at the end of the round. The match-ups for the next round revealed that she would be battling Gladion. In <i><a href=# title=SM131>The Battlefield of Truth and Love!</a></i>, Lillie and Gladion mutually promised not to hold back against each other, despite Lillie's acknowledgment that she couldn't match up to her brother's skill. Lillie used Snowy against his <a href=# title="Gladion's Umbreon">Umbreon</a>, making good use of Snowy's <a href=# title="Snow Cloak (Ability)">Snow Cloak</a> <a href=# title=Ability>Ability</a> and performing Subzero Slammer. Despite this, Umbreon defeated Snowy, thus eliminating Lillie from the competition.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM139>Enter the Champion!</a></i>, Lillie attended the award ceremony for Ash's victory in the Manalo Conference, only for it to be interrupted when a <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Guzzlord</a> arrived at the stadium through a wormhole. In <i><a href=# title=SM140>Z-Move Showdown!</a></i>, Lillie helped evacuate innocent civilians to safety. When a second, <a href=# title="Shiny Pokémon">Shiny</a> <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Guzzlord</a> appeared in the shopping area, Lillie, Sophocles, Lana, and Mallow helped Kiawe, Gladion, and <a href=# title=Hau>Hau</a> battle it. By combining their Z-Moves into one giant attack, Lillie and the others managed to successfully knock the Shiny Guzzlord back into <a href=# title="Ultra Space">Ultra Space</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM145>Dreams of the Sun and Moon!</a></i>, with the Alola League over, Lillie and her classmates returned to their usual routine at the Pokémon School. When asked what she planned on doing for the upcoming vacation, Lillie revealed that she planned on continuing her efforts to restore Magearna. Later, at Mohn's lab, Lillie had Gladion send out his <a href=# title="Zoroark (Pokémon)">Zoroark</a> so it could be reunited with Magearna. Reminded of the past, Zoroark created an <a href=# title="Illusion (Ability)">illusion</a> of when Mohn witnessed Lillie's first steps. Witnessing Mohn's love for his family firsthand, Lillie expressed her desire to see her father, causing Magearna to fully activate.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=SM146>Thank You, Alola! The Journey Continues!</a></i>, Lillie introduced her classmates to Magearna and revealed that it possessed the ability to track Mohn's whereabouts. She announced that she would spend her vacation going on a journey with Gladion and Lusamine to find Mohn, promising to return once they succeeded in their goal. The next day, Lillie said her goodbyes to her friends, taking one last photo with them before boarding a cruise ship. As the ship began to leave, Lillie remembered the times she spent with Ash and went back to thank him for all his help.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Journeys:_The_Series></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Journeys:_The_Series><i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i></span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/01/Gladion_Lillie_Family_JN.png/375px-Gladion_Lillie_Family_JN.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie and her family<p>Lillie appeared in a flashback in <i><a href=# title=JN037>That New Old Gang of Mine!</a></i> while Lana read a letter from her, explaining how she was doing during the search for her father.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN111>The Homecoming Crown!</a></i>, Lillie and her family arrived at the <a href=# title="Crown Tundra">Crown Tundra</a> in the <a href=# title=Galar>Galar</a> region to find Mohn. After camping out during a blizzard for the night, they reunited with Mohn at a cabin. However, they found out that Mohn had amnesia and failed to remember them. They also discovered that a <a href=# title="Shiny Pokémon">Shiny</a> <a href=# title="Nihilego (Pokémon)">Nihilego</a>, <a href=# title=Nickname>nicknamed</a> "Lillie", had been living with Mohn, with him believing that the Ultra Beast was his daughter. While Lusamine talked with Mohn, Lillie and Gladion decided to look around the cabin for clues, which led them to finding their father's old clothes and a mirror in a room. Through the aid of Ash, <a href=# title=Goh>Goh</a>, and <a href=# title=Chloe>Chloe</a>, Lillie and Gladion were able to snap Mohn out of his amnesia by making him see his reflection in the mirror, and the reunited family embraced each other. Seeing that Nihilego was leaving, Lillie stopped the Parasite Pokémon before it disappeared, as she and her family were grateful for everything it did for Mohn and invited it to come back to Alola with them, which it happily accepted. Lillie joined her family to capture Nihilego in a <a href=# title="Beast Ball">Beast Ball</a> before joining in on a group photo of the reunited family.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN112>Helping the Hometown Hero!</a></i>, Lillie's family, Ash, Goh, and Chloe arrived in Alola, attending a party to celebrate their return. During the party, Lillie reunited with Mallow, Sophocles, Lana, and most of her friends. The next day, Lillie watched a <a href=# title="Battle Royal">Battle Royal</a> match between Ash, Kiawe, Gladion, and Professor Kukui.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN131>Paring Pokémon While Parrying!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=JN132>Partners in Time!</a></i>, Lillie was seen watching Ash's <a href=# title="Masters Eight Tournament">Masters Eight Tournament</a> match against <a href=# title="Leon (anime)">Leon</a> at the <a href=# title="Pokémon School">Pokémon School</a>.<br clear=all></p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Character>Character</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/da/Younger_Lillie.png/375px-Younger_Lillie.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> The incident that caused Lillie's fear<p>Lillie is a polite, innocent, and kindhearted girl from a wealthy upbringing, who always cares for and shows concern for others. Due to the trauma she sustained when she was attacked by a <a href=# title="Nihilego (Pokémon)">Nihilego</a> and then rescued by <a href=# title="Gladion's Silvally">Gladion's Silvally</a> as a child, she is terrified of physically interacting with Pokémon, and tends to freeze up whenever one Pokémon enters her personal space; in <i><a href=# title=SM005>Yo, Ho, Ho! Go, Popplio!</a></i>, she goes so far as to wear a full suit of diving gear to avoid making contact with Pokémon during a fishing class. When other characters point out her fear, she denies it by saying she simply avoids Pokémon by choice until she concedes to her inability in <i><a href=# title=SM008>Lillie's Egg-xhilirating Adventure</a></i>. Despite this, Lillie enjoys studying Pokémon from a researcher's perspective, and is comfortable with being around them at a safe distance. In <i><a href=# title=SM014>Getting to Know You!</a></i>, she became comfortable with touching her own <a href=# title=Snowy>Pokémon</a>, and she has been shown touching other Pokémon since then, such as <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a> in <i><a href=# title=SM030>The Ol' Raise and Switch!</a></i> and a <a href=# title="Stoutland (Pokémon)">Stoutland</a> in <i><a href=# title=SM032>Treasure Hunt, Akala Style!</a></i>. However, in <i><a href=# title=SM048>Night of a Thousand Poses!</a></i>, she regresses to the point where she can't even touch Snowy after her memory of Silvally resurfaces, in which Silvally seemingly attacked her. After remembering that Silvally had protected her from Nihilego years earlier, Lillie completely overcame her fear, becoming eager to make contact with as many Pokémon as possible.</p><p>Lillie is extremely knowledgeable about the behavior, types, and background of Alola's resident Pokémon species and <a href=# title="Regional form">regional forms</a>, including <a href=# title="Guardian deities">guardian deities</a> such as <a href=# title="Tapu Koko (Pokémon)">Tapu Koko</a>. However, she appears to know little about Pokémon in other <a href=# title=Region>regions</a>, as seen when she expresses surprise that <a href=# title="Exeggutor (Pokémon)">Exeggutor</a>—a <a href=# title="Grass (type)">Grass</a>/<a href=# title="Dragon (type)">Dragon</a>-type Pokémon in Alola—is a Grass/<a href=# title="Psychic (type)">Psychic</a>-type Pokémon elsewhere. She also has a tendency to bring up information that she has gathered from books. In <i><a href=# title=SM045>Now You See Them, Now You Don't!</a></i>, Lillie is revealed to enjoy writing in her journal before she goes to sleep.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/2b/Lillie_and_Hobbes.png/375px-Lillie_and_Hobbes.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie and Hobbes<p>Lillie has a strained relationship with her mother, <a href=# title="Lusamine (anime)">Lusamine</a>. As shown in <i><a href=# title=SM044>A Dream Encounter!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=SM046>Deceiving Appearances!</a></i>, she is seen frequently getting exasperated whenever Lusamine treats her like a child, acting completely unlike her more reserved and quiet self. Another example of this was Lusamine's decision to evolve her <a href=# title="Clefairy (Pokémon)">Clefairy</a>, whom Lillie was close to, into <a href=# title="Lusamine's Clefable">Clefable</a> without ever considering Lillie's feelings on the matter, thus upsetting Lillie greatly. She is also constantly annoyed whenever Lusamine becomes distracted by her work and prioritizes it over spending time with her. However, <i><a href=# title=SM048>Night of a Thousand Poses!</a></i> reveals how the two were much closer during Lillie's youth before Lusamine became more absorbed in her <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Ultra Beasts</a> research. During the events of <i><a href=# title=SM054>10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!</a></i>, after Lusamine had fallen under <a href=# title="Ultra Beasts (anime)">Nihilego</a>'s control, Lillie finally told her how much she hated her for her babying attitude, especially since Lusamine had been acting even more like a child under the Ultra Beast's influence. Lillie also refused to accept the possessed Lusamine as her mother unless she could fight its control, admitting that Lusamine was an incredibly strong person for keeping up her research for many years. After her words reached through to Lusamine, Lillie's relationship with her improved considerably, admiring her mother's compassion for starting the <a href=# title="Ultra Guardians">Ultra Guardians</a> to rescue lost Ultra Beasts.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/4c/Lillie_Gumshoos_Drawing.png/375px-Lillie_Gumshoos_Drawing.png decoding=async width=250 height=140 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie sketching a Gumshoos<p>Lillie does not do well in athletic activities, mainly due to her tendency to get nervous and close her eyes, thus throwing off her aim. She failed to throw Poké Balls, such as in <i><a href=# title=SM014>Getting to Know You!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=SM078>Twirling with a Bang!</a></i>, or plastic balls onto a target, as shown in the extra scene of the latter episode, as well as the shurikens during one of the <a href=# title="Kantonian Gym">Kantonian Gym</a>'s challenges in <i><a href=# title=SM118>Aiming for the Top Floor!</a></i>. She also could not jump over the vaulting box in <i><a href=# title=SM085>The Long Vault Home!</a></i>. In addition, Lillie has shown to enjoy taking photos of Pokémon and sightseeing in general. This was seen in <i><a href=# title=SM105>Showdown on Poni Island!</a></i>, where she and Snowy spent much of their time doing so at <a href=# title="Poni Island">Poni Island</a> as part of their research project. In the <a href=# title=SM106>following episode</a>, she was revealed to be a competent artist, as she drew a fairly accurate sketch of a <a href=# title="Gumshoos (Pokémon)">Gumshoos</a> that she had seen the previous day.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d5/Ash_and_Lillie.png/375px-Ash_and_Lillie.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie and Ash<p>Lillie seems to look up to <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> because of his love for Pokémon and upbeat personality; in addition, she also occasionally takes inspiration from Ash, as seen when she bonded with his Pikachu through a battle with <a href=# title=Hobbes>Hobbes</a> in <i><a href=# title=SM030>The Ol' Raise and Switch!</a></i>, as well as using Ash's <a href=# title="Double Battle">Double Battle</a> against <a href=# title=Olivia>Olivia</a> to team up with a wild Alolan <a href=# title="Sandshrew (Pokémon)">Sandshrew</a> to battle a <a href=# title="Tyranitar (Pokémon)">Tyranitar</a> that was trespassing its home in <i><a href=# title=SM080>Not Caving Under Pressure!</a></i>. Lillie has been occasionally shown to lose her composure when pushed into a wall, but usually manages to pick herself back up through her friends' support and encouragement. This is shown when she was able to put an end to her fear of touching Pokémon in <i><a href=# title=SM049>Mission: Total Recall!</a></i> and perfecting <a href=# title="Subzero Slammer (move)">Subzero Slammer</a> with Snowy in <i><a href=# title=SM127>Chasing Memories, Creating Dreams!</a></i>.</p><p>Lillie has changed greatly during her time at the <a href=# title="Pokémon School">Pokémon School</a> with her classmates, but her tendency to bring up information that she read in books have remained. Lillie has also become courageous, optimistic, and upbeat. In addition, Lillie has shown to not be afraid to speak her mind, especially if it's defending or standing up for her family and friends. However, despite her growth, Lillie hesitated in trying new things, as shown in <i><a href=# title=SM113>This Magik Moment!</a></i>, when she wasn't sure about accepting <a href=# title="George Charino">George Charino</a>'s offer to do an episode of <i>The Refreshing Trio: Alola Idols</i> with <a href=# title="Mallow (anime)">Mallow</a> and <a href=# title="Lana (anime)">Lana</a>, but changed her mind when she wanted to discover another side of herself. This was shown again in <i><a href=# title=SM115>The Dealer of Destruction!</a></i>, when Lillie was unassertive about participating in the <a href=# title="Manalo Conference">Manalo Conference</a>, until she officially decided to participate in <i><a href=# title=SM123>A Fiery Training Camp Trick!</a></i>, after some encouragement from Lana and <a href=# title="Professor Kukui (anime)">Professor Kukui</a>.<br clear=all></p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/7e/Lillie_and_her_Pok%C3%A9mon.png/375px-Lillie_and_her_Pok%C3%A9mon.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lillie with Snowy and Magearna<p>Much like the younger <a href=# title=Max>traveling</a> <a href=# title="Bonnie (anime)">companions</a>, Lillie didn't have any Pokémon in her <a href=# title=SM001>debut episode</a>, due to her fear of touching them at the time.
